# Garmin Monitor

To set up, modify the `config.json` file to add your Garmin username as well
as webhooks to ping (with POST request) upon success or failure (note: IFTTT is a great service for
this as you can initiate a notification based upon this).

### Requirements

Your Garmin profile must be set to public for this method to work. Garmin has no
public API available, so this is unfortunately the way to do things.
